# Application of Machine learning models in the drinking water distribution system (DWDS)
This project demonstrates a Python-based approach to replicating the Sankey Diagram that was originally presented in Figure 5 (top panel) of the study:

While the study included the Sankey diagram, the underlying Python script used to generate it was not published. This project provides an opportunity to showcase the original script I developed for visualizing the flow dynamics within a Drinking Water Distribution System (DWDS).

## Key Highlights:
- Reproducing a Published Visualization: Lightweight script Demonstrates [Sankey_for_DWDS.py](https://github.com/HomantoFeng/Sankey_Diagram_DWDS/blob/main/Sankey_for_DWDS.py) how the Sankey diagram from the study was generated using Python.
- Open-Source and Reproducible: Makes the original unpublished script available for others to use and modify.
- Practical Application in Water Systems: Highlights the use of Sankey diagrams to analyze and communicate data in DWDS research.
